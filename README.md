# Chef's Companion

## Project Description

Chef's Companion is a web application designed to help users manage and discover recipes. It provides functionalities for viewing recipes, and potentially managing user-generated content like recipe ratings and uploads.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chefs-companion.git
    cd chefs-companion
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

To run the application, ensure your virtual environment is activated and then execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application should then be accessible in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or similar, as indicated by the Flask server).
